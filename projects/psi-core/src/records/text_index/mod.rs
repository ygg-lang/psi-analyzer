/// This depends on the use-case. Often raw `usize` or a newtype wrapper around
/// `usize` is sufficient. However, raw byte offsets are not stable at all when a
/// text document changes.
///
/// Usually, a text document is an input to later stages of the pipelines. Let's
/// take a simple incremental pipeline:
/// ```text
/// text: string ->
///  symbols: Symbol { ..., start: usize, end: usize } ->
///  diagnostics: Diag { ..., start: usize, end: usize }
/// ```
///
/// Now, any change to `text` on line N will shift all `start` and `end` offsets,
/// which will invalidate all symbols and diagnostics following the change and
/// require recomputation.
///
/// However, if `start` and `end` are [`Pos`]es then only the line where the
/// change was made is affected. Symbols and diagnostic for other lines won't be
/// invalidated.
